# qr-code-reader
First import all libraries
for cv2 use this command 'pip insatll opencv-python'
Then make sure you have an image of a QR-Code. You can name whatever you think is good but don't forget to modify it in the code if I haven't already modified it to allow the selection of an image. ;-)
Last thing, ;-) this script is mainly based on how to read QR-Code of ouwr vaccination pass and health pass
